(it was a prank) | Apologies for the title gore, but there's no other way to word this.\n\nEssentially, what happened was this. I (22M) went to the store with my sister (26F). \n\nWhile we're in the store, we see a guy in his 30s in a fancy suit with a boy who looks to be 12 years old. He's pushing around this kid, saying ''I'm going to beat you so hard'', etc.\n\nWell my sister works in CPS and she goes to the guy and says ''Excuse me, I work in CPS''. He looks at her and tells her ''I'm in the Mafia, what are you are going to do about it?''. My sister goes quiet and looks scared, starts sweating nervously. \n\nAt this point, I realised this whole thing was a prank. I had seen this type of prank on YouTube, where a guy pranks people pretending to abuse a kid (actor) and tells people he's in the mafia. And he encountered several ''CPS types'' who act righteous but then go quiet when the guy claims to be a Mafiosa.\n\nI start smiling and my sister gets more scared, the dude fesses up and says ''Relax, its just a prank. There's a camera over there'' and my sister is relieved. \n\nWell when we left the store, I started laughing and my sister gets angry, she calls me an asshole for smiling about that. But I thought it was funny, moreover I asked her, what the hell is CPS going to do against a Mafiosa? Nothing. I just found the whole thing funny. AITA?",
