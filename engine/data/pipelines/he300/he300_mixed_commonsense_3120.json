    "text": "AITA For texting my friend how inappropriate her behavior was? | So last night, myself and a friend of mine had shows we directed and have been working on for about a month open, in the same theatre in repertory (my friend\u2019s show was before mine). I was unable to actually see my own show as one of my cast members was violently ill and I took her place onstage. After the show, partially because I was unable to see it, I asked my friend and her boyfriend (both of whom are close friends of mine) what they thought of my show. They informed me that they were unable to pay attention to it because a mutual friend of ours was sitting next to them and talking to them through large parts of the show. Of course, it is theatre etiquette 101 not to talk while a show is happening, and I was pissed off since my friends were unable to watch my show because of uncorteous audience behavior. So I texted my mutual friend who talked for the entire show and told her that I was disappointed and kinda angry at her for talking through my show, informed her how sad I was that my friends were unable to watch my show due to her talking, and told her if she had no interest in seeing a show that she should simply not watch it instead of coming in and talking through the whole thing. I texted her about twelve hours ago and have received no response. Reddit, AITA?",
