    "text": "AITA for not giving my college roommate free rides back home because of a lease \"benefit\" I received? | At the beginning of the year, we both signed a lease to get a nice apartment right off-campus.  When we went in to sign the lease, they had a deal going on in which we were able to choose between 50% off a parking spot or a free Nintendo Switch. Since my roommate and I do not have time for video games, he told me he was cool with me getting the 50% off parking since I am the only one that owns a car. I have a car on campus as it is helpful for getting groceries and I like to go back home at least once a month.\n\nI usually give him rides back home as our hometowns are very near each other and we typically split the gas. I usually charge him around $30 for a round trip back home that is three hours away. I never charge him for gas when we go grocery shopping or cruise around town.  Out of nowhere, he has been subtly bringing up the fact that he deserves at least 3-4 free rides back home because he received \"no benefit\" out of signing the lease. Right off the bat, I said no because I still had to pay for the parking spot and there are much more expenses that go into my car other than just the gas. I truly believe he is getting a benefit out of this as he is paying much less for a round trip to home compared to taking the bus or the train. He keeps bringing up the fact that he got \"no benefit\" out of the deal at least once a week since we started school this semester and he has been making me feel as if I am in the wrong for this. He has now even said that I owe *him* half of what I paid for the parking spot. My philosophy is that if he truly had an issue with this he should have brought it up at the time we signed the apartment lease. AITA for not giving in and giving him free rides back home?",
