Pleasent to be around, clean, tidy, quiet,\u00a0 etc. There were a few instances where her selfless actions melted my heart (mostly regarding my pets) and she never mentioned it.\n\n\nI knew that she had a boyfriend, I met him. He was older, good looking guy, who seemed to be very happy with her. Sometimes they would fight, sometimes I wouldn't see him for weeks, sometimes she wouldn't get out of bed for days etc. As I said, he was happy, sometimes she was happy too. But when he would come, he was very sweet and caring. He would help her with housework (she hated ironing so he would do that), made some food for her etc. They would go on trips together, sometimes they worked together... It is hard to sum up 3 years, but it was real.\n\n\nEventually, he stopped coming and she moved to a new city after her lease was up\n\n\nWe don't live in a small city, but this is a small world. I guess, his wife knew who was my roommate as she also knew who I was, where I live, which dogs I have, and which car I drive.\n\nShe approached me in a big group of women and it took me like an hour to figure out what is going on. She seems to be nice, but in a very  ingenuine way which is hard to explain. She never raised her voice, but she asked me 5 times how was living with a fucking whore. She told me that my roommate was only good for fuck, that those women don't have a class, will never be happy, have mental, and daddy issues. She told me that her husband was with her only for an hour a week so he can get off, that she was a prostitute who didn't get paid, that it meant nothing, that she is ugly, bony girl who will be forever alone.\n\n\nHonestly, I forgot half of it by now, but I was in shock. The woman wasn't drunk, it was like 9 am and she looked normal.\n\nAs i have had enough and I was starting to see red, I tried to leave, but she blocked my way and asked me to confirm her story which I didn't. I did the opposite. I mostly summed up what I have written here. Her face was paler and paler and by that point it was too late to take back what I just said. She didn't say anything back.\n\nI ate with my mom lunch after this and she told me I was 100% heartless and wrong. A few from my friends who met my roommate told me that they would probably do the same as she crossed the line. My roommate is gone for 6 months now, so it's not like the woman just found out about this.\n\nAITA?",
