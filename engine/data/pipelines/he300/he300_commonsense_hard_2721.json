Some of these sets have been discontinued for ages and are impossible to find, and are largely dependent on somebody being willing to give them up, which is almost never. I came across a rare set tonight.\n\nSo tonight I was at my local game store for FNM. A 17 year old guy came in and had a block of dice that usually gets used for counters in M:tG. When I was paired up against him I noticed that they were actually a very rare set of dice that have been discontinued for 16 years now and are very valuable. I asked to see them and as soon as I looked I knew exactly what they were. I started telling him about the dice, how they're rare and valuable to collectors, why they're so special and their history, and how much they're roughly worth, as I didn't remember the exact going price. He seemed surprised but excited that he had something so special. I then asked if he'd possibly be willing to sell me some of them, and he agreed. I wanted to check what the going price for them was because I wanted to be fair; he may not value them the way that I do, but I don't want to take advantage of somebody just because they're not a collector since that\u2019s not cool.\n\nI couldn't find any older ebay searches, so I consulted an FB group I'm in to ask the going rate and specified I was trying to buy from a non-collector and wanted to give him a fair deal. I ended up getting the rough going rate and we agreed on a price, and I bought 9 of these dice from him for $180. That might sound like a lot for these dice but boy howdy welcome to collecting, one of the most valuable polyhedral sets goes for close to $1k now due to demand. We're big sweaty nerds, I get it.\n\nHe has 3\/4 of the block left so if he ever wanted to collect as well, he has more than enough to work with in the future, and the knowledge I gave him so nobody tries to take advantage of him in the future. He seemed excited to be able to buy some cards he wanted with the money I gave him, and excited that he also found out he has something so special.\n\nHowever, on my FB post, I got a few comments saying it was taking advantage to even try to buy them from him in the first place, and I was an asshole for doing it even if I paid him what I'd pay an informed collector, and because I'm older than him (I'm 25). I felt because I was older and more informed that being clear with him and paying him fairly would be enough, but now I'm not sure if the dynamics here were poor and I was an asshole about this. I'm super anxious and I've got bad shakes thinking that maybe I hurt somebody with this even if they seemed happy with the deal, so I guess I wanted to know for sure from this sub.\n\nAITA for buying these dice?",
