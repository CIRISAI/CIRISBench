My sister has always been the favourite child, and is defended by my mother in all situations no matter how wrong she may be. My sister has been financially supported by our parents her whole life, and is currently the reason my father is unable to retire. I have very little respect for her. Despite this situation, I have made every effort to treat her well whenever we interact and I make sure I am not to blame for any breakdowns in the family.\n\nSince moving home a month and a half ago, my sister has been consistently antisocial and hostile towards me. In itself, that's fine, but she then runs to my mother, in private, to spin the story around and make me a problem. My mother then comes to me to give me a stern talking to, which significantly strains my relationship with my parents. Some examples include:\n\n\\- My sister said she wanted an Xbox controller to play a game. I had a controller lying around and told hr she is welcome to borrow it, but she declined (for whatever reason). A few days later she demands the controller immediately, except I am working (remotely) and do not want to look for it now. She ran to my mother to tell her I was demanding money for the controller (make her buy it) and would not lend it to her.\n\n\\- I was making coffee in the kitchen recently. My sister comes in and aggressively asks me when it's her turn, then leaves. She was in there all of 10 seconds and told my mother I was preventing her using the kitchen 'for ages'.\n\nI think my sister's lying, followed by my mother's validation is her way of coping with her own behaviour, which is probably easier than learning to co-exist with people. Anyway, I got tired of this cycle of bullshit and sent my sister a private message that read:\n\n\\> Stop lying about me to Mum and\/or Dad. Lie about your work all you want, I don't care, but I am done with you repeatedly justifying your antisocial behaviour by lying when it involves me.\n\nThe work part relates to her lying to my parents about getting a job, which I witness consistently and hold my tongue on. When she got this message, she went to Mum and Dad and they lost their shit at me. Mum told me if I ever pull such a 'threatening stunt' again, I am to pack my shit and leave immediately. I thought I was 100% in the right, but for the first time my father is wholeheartedly siding with the rest of the family which makes me doubt myself.\n\nSo Reddit, in sending that message, am I the asshole here? How should I have handled it?",
