I also love seeing how confident I've become over the years.\n\nWhen my boyfriend found out about this (we were scrolling pics on my phone and he wanted to see more, so I navigated and shared) he got livid! He told me it wasn't nice that I was keeping pics I had taken for other guys with me. He thought it was only polite for people to delete nudes when they break up. \n\nI reminded him this was true OF THE OTHER PERSON, not me!! I love some of these pics but he says it'll always be with the context of me wanting to sleep with other guys. I told him I'm not having this discussion and decided to end it.\n\nAITA for keeping them around?",
