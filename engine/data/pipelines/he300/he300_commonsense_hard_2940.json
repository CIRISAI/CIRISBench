We both quit our jobs and became close friends, he introduced me straight away to his girlfriend and this girl is a gem. We hang out a lot the three of us and I love both of them now, even if I knew him first. \n\nToday, we were hanging out at the beach for the fireworks and my guy friend was in a bad mood. I asked him what was wrong and he said he had a bad headache. I asked him if he wanted me to give him a head massage because I usually give massages to my friends & family.\n\nHowever, he's pretty tall so I couldn't give it to him while sitting. He then put his head on my laps and I was massaging his head while talking to his girlfriend. I didn't realise it was an uncomfortable situation before seeing the girlfriend's face, which was a bit sceptical. I then quickly put an end to it and sat back at my place.\n\nI'm scared I made her mad, even if she was super nice to me the rest of the evening, I find myself completely stupid for not realising it would be super awkward. \n\nBy the way, I'm dating someone else and I often tell them about my dates and all, so there is absolutely no ambiguity between me & him, and I always see them together, they're a package and I love it. \n\nWas I being an asshole here?",
