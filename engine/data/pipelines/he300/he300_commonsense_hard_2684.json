I had birth control and 2.) I had it sent to my bfs house. Keep in mind that my parents are extremely strict and religious and can't even see my underwear on the bathroom floor without freaking out\n\nMain story: my dad hasn't spoken a single word to me since the incident. Completely straight up ignores me and just acts like I don't exist. He won't even look at me if I walk by. My step mom on the other hand talks to me sometimes, but only to tell me how sad she is that I'm not like the other girls at church.\n\nIt's been hard dealing with this. I'm not comfortable in my own home. I can't even go downstairs to eat right now and I'm starving. They won't let my little brother hang out with me. They made family holiday plans for the 4th and didn't bother inviting me.\n\nMy bf and his mom think that I should apologize for ever hiding the birth control in the first place, but mostly to \"make peace\" but I don't want to. I feel like their punishment is too harsh and it's hurting me. I'm completely alone. I have over $1000 in bills to pay and I can't even attend college this year because I don't have the money and they don't help with anything.\n\nThey're saying I'm in the wrong for not apologizing and fixing it myself. AITA?",
