If the result is very clear it wasn't for karma whoring... I am just horrible in reading social queues and feel guilty very fast.\n\nSo yesterday we had a friends get together. We were 5 meat eaters and two vegetarians. I decided to make empanadas. So I made about 25 meat/chicken empanadas and 10 cheese empanadas. So everyone could eat 5 empanadas ideally. I love to cook so it's not a problem.\n\nWhen they all arrived I was taking out the second sheet of empanadas and started to put them on different plates. 1 plate for Chicken one for meat and one for cheese. So I put them on the table and explain which is which. One of the meat eaters wanted to take one of the cheese empanadas and I told them that I had just made enough of them for our two vegetarian friends. They looked kinda put off at me and just took one of the other ones. So the night progresses and one of the vegetarians comes up to me and asks me if I had made anymore of the cheese empanadas because their tray only had 3 left and both of them had only eaten 1 per person. I was kinda shocked because I had made enough for everyone and it wasn't such a big get together that people wouldn't have heard me. So I paused the music and reminded the people that the cheese empanadas were only enough for 2 people and to please be more considerate of others. I was a bit annoyed by this point but let it go. Today I resived a text from one of my friends calling me out for my \"snobbish\" behavior and that ofcourse everyone would like to taste every empanada as they are not common in Europe.\n\nNow I feel like an ass for reprimanding them. AITA ?",
