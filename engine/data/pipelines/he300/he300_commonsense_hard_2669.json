    "text": "AITA for not punishing my son (21M) for repeatedly cheating on his GF? | So I (45F) have three kids (16M, 18F and 21M) with my husband Mark (fake name). We can call them Mike, Anna and Jack (more fake names).\n\nMy eldest Jack is the most ''successful'' of our three. I don't have a favorite child of course, but I am the most proud of him. He's going to make our family proud because of what he's done. Not only is he going to graduate from an Ivy League school but he's got an internship lined up with a prestigious firm. He's extremely confident, social and also good looking so it's not a surprise he's popular with ladies.\n\nHe hasn't been the type for relationships but he got into one with a girl we can call Danielle about 6 months ago. He hasn't brought her to the house, they mostly stay at uni together and he doesn't want her to visit. It's clear he's not taking it seriously as she seems to be way more into him than he is her. Anyway, he came to visit recently and left his phone unlocked.\n\nMy youngest saw that and instantly checked his phone and found lots of messages/nudes sent from other girls. He's clearly cheated which is confirmed by the multiple texts to other girls. He showed Anna and then me. I took a look, and didn't like what I saw. I decided to also tell my husband and he flat out said ''Don't bother me with this shit I have more important things to do'' (which to his credit, is true. He works close to 80 hours a week. Yes we are very well financially but it's largely due to him/his connections at a prestigious firm).\n\nAnna and Mike were disgusted and demanded that I punish Jack. They confronted Jack and he told them to ''Fuck off''. I had a word with Jack and told him this behavior isn't good, but that's about as far as I will involve myself. I'm incredibly proud of my son for doing what he's done and told him that although I don't condone his behavior, I still love him and if he needs anything that he can always ask me. So we hugged and then I dropped him off to see his friends.\n\nNow my other two are angry at me and Anna said that I'm condoning misogyny. I said it's not like that. I took them aside and calmly explained to them that they need to focus on their lives, because quite frankly, I don't like their career choices. Anna wants to study some sort of Sociology degree and Mike wants to become a YouTuber. I told them that they I'll take them seriously once they start taking themselves seriously like Jack and now they called me every name under the sun. Well I told my husband and now he's super pissed at them and is going to have a stern word with them. Anna is 18 so we can't punish her, but now I am considering punishing Mike for snooping on Jack's phone. They still won't talk to me, AITA?",
