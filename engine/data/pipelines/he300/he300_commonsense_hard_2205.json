I specifically told them I wanted to do absolutely nothing. I didn\u2019t just say \u201cnothing\u201d. I made it clear that I wanted to sit in my room and do absolutely nothing because they\u2019ve made the mistake of confusing \u201cnothing\u201d for \u201chey I have no expectations so just throw a small last minute get-together.\n\nI said nothing because I\u2019ll be going back to college in a week and I know my friends are throwing me a party and I\u2019m not really the type of person to enjoy a lot of parties.\n\nSo back to today, I wake up and repeat that I want to do absolutely nothing but alas I get called downstairs in the evening and my mom tells me to change into nicer clothes and come greet our guests as she\u2019s invited a whole bunch of neighbors and friends.\n\nI don\u2019t want to make a scene so I change and come downstairs but I take my mon aside and I\u2019m like ??????  and asking her why tf she did this while also getting mad at her. Her response was basically that my sister wanted to cut a cake(she\u2019s 9 and I just turned 20).\n\nSo I basically got really mad at my mom and I ended up crying a little because I really hate parties and social interaction with people I don\u2019t want to spend my birthday with. (I did yell at her a bit and that was a slight overreaction so prob the asshole on that part).\n\nAITA for getting mad at/yelling at my mom for throwing me a party when I specifically asked to not have one?",
