    "text": "AITA for kicking out this mother from volunteering? | I volunteer often at a soup kitchen in my town (at least once a week) and I normally end up getting put \u201cin charge\u201d. Far too often, we get parents that are taking their kids there to \u201cteach them a lesson in gratefulness\u201d which I don\u2019t agree with. Of course kids should be grateful, but I don\u2019t think that people down on their luck are props for these people to use for a couple of hours. They can hear everything these people are saying, and it\u2019s just degrading in my opinion. Teach your kids about being grateful and then you can also teach them that it\u2019s good to give back, volunteer your time, etc. \n\nThen over the weekend, a mom brought her 12-year-old daughter in to volunteer. The mom had a smug look on her face and insisted her daughter serve food, so she \u201cgot a good look at the homeless\u201d. Normally we don\u2019t let kids scoop the food, but I did let her give out the rolls because it wasn\u2019t worth the argument at the moment. The mother was scooping the food and to give her credit, she was being good with the people who were coming through the line. Her daughter looked like most of the kids that come, bored, unmoved. One outing at a soup kitchen isn\u2019t going to turn your kid grateful for their iPad. But again, not my business, so we move on. \n\nThe mom did keep making comments, however, to her daughter when we had a lull, such as \u201cDo you see how good you have it?\u201d and \u201cCan you imagine how humiliating it\u2019d have to be to come here?\u201d it was annoying, but I just had to let it go because at least she wasn\u2019t saying it in front of the people that were utilizing our services.\n\nThen a bit later in the night, a girl that was probably in her later teens (but still a minor), came through the line. The mom started talking to her, and the girl shared that she had been kicked out of her home. As soon as she said this, the mother turns to her daughter and says, \u201cYou see, Rebecca, if you don\u2019t stop with your smart mouth, this could be you some day!\u201d\n\nThe teen looked humiliated. I was pissed. At this point, I finished serving the teenager, told her about services that could help her in the area and apologized. I then turned to the mother and said \u201cYou need to leave.\u201d She said I couldn\u2019t make her. I said she was being highly inappropriate and making the people feel uncomfortable. \n\nThe mother tried to explain her daughter was ungrateful and I said \u201cThis isn\u2019t the way, just get the hell out.\u201d \n\nThe daughter said \u201cLet\u2019s just go, Mom, this whole thing is stupid.\u201d\n\nThe mom huffed, grabbed their stuff and they left. \n\nNow, I know this looks like a validation post\u2026but it\u2019s not. I was sharing this point of view and what happened with a fellow volunteer friend. She says that what does it matter, so long as people get fed. She thinks kicking the girl out ruined a chance for her and the mom to learn and I could\u2019ve handled it a lot better. So, I bring it here. AITA? Should I have tried talking to them more?",
