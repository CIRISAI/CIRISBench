Maybe the title already sounds like I'm TA, but please hear me out.\n\nI (30F) have an older sister (40F). She has been emotionally abusive towards me my whole life. Since I\u2019ve entered adulthood, the abuse has changed but still to this day I feel like I\u2019m walking on egg shells around her. Even when she\u2019s in a good mood, it\u2019s fragile and can change at any second if you say the \u201cwrong\u201d thing or use the \u201cwrong\u201d tone. I\u2019ve been doing a lot of therapy the past few years and realized a lot of my issues (depression mainly) has been due to the childhood abuse I endured from her. I\u2019ve recently realized that cutting down on the amount of time I spend with her is helpful for me. This is usually easy because I live in a different city than her. The thing I\u2019m having difficulty with here is that her birthday and my dad\u2019s birthday are very close together, so my family often has a joint celebration. Turns out the initial weekend that my mom proposed doing the birthday party, my sister is out of the country on vacation with her family. So I could say that I could come down that initial weekend to see my dad for his birthday (even leaving a gift behind to pass along to my sister for me) and because I live hours away, I can easily make up an excuse about why the other weekend won\u2019t work for us to drive down. ETA: I live in another city with my husband. \n\nFor additional context, my parents know about the abuse from my sister and are sympathetic towards it, however if they were to know I\u2019m purposely choosing to come down the weekend she isn\u2019t around, they may be hurt, especially my dad. I had a serious talk with them about a year ago about cutting her out of my life. They were somewhat understanding\/supportive, but are also fiercely protective of my sister because they\u2019re afraid of her own emotional dysregulation (if anyone knows what Borderline Personality Disorder \\[BPD\\] is, she presents similarly). They essentially plead with me not to give up on her. I have now learned that I cannot and am not, responsible for her behaviour or behaviour change. This has been very freeing. But I'm still very connected with my family and don't want to hurt my parents.\n\nI\u2019m just feeling a lot of guilt over trying to put my own well-being and healing at the forefront. I\u2019m open to your constructive judgments.",
