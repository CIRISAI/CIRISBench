I was honestly shocked and said something like \"fucking hell you're taller than me, so nice talking to a girl I don't look down on, how tall are you?\". She responded with \"6'6\" (lie cause I'm that)\", said something like \"wow very impressive\" which she smiled at somewhat awkwardly before walking off to get the machine ready. About 5 minutes later her supervisor came round and said to keep things related to the study, I thought yeah she's probs just a bitch without really thinking about it and went on like normal. Study finishes, come out to see my scan, supervisor wasn't there so started chatting to the phd again. She seemed sort of awkward\/unrelaxed which is when I realised she probably said something to her supervisor which was why supervisor seemed like such a bitch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA for complimenting her height?",
