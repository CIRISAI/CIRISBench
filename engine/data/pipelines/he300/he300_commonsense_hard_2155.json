So my mother is a bit on the heavy side and likes to wear jeans a lot. Anyway, she never ever wears them with a belt and every time she sits on a stool, bends down, or just is doing anything, she\u2019s flashing a plumbers smile. The very first thing my boyfriend saw when I introduced him to my parents was her damn butt crack, and he told me later he felt super awkward bc of this. This isn\u2019t some body shaming or weird jealousy thing, and I\u2019m not saying she should wear one in the house always, I just think it\u2019s kinda inappropriate for her to be unknowingly crack-flashing our guests all the time. WIBTA if I told her this as politely as possible and asked her to wear a belt",
