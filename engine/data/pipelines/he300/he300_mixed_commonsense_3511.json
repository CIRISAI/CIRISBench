I didn't know they hired dancers until the lights were dimmed and the people were literally walking inside. It's not really my thing these days but I thought it would be rude to leave, so I took a seat and watched as a male and female dancer gave them each a lap dance as they sat back to back. It got pretty rowdy, lots of whistles, yelling, etc. Eventually the dancers began working the room, dancing with other people, going back to my friend and her BF, etc.\n\n  \nOut of nowhere the woman dancer came to me, took my hand, pulled me to my friend and basically began involving me in a lap dance. That caught a lot of people's attention and there was a big response (phones out, yelling things, you get the idea). I went along with it for a bit but stuck to light grinding, similar to how I'd dance at a club\/party. Then my friend stood up and they pushed me down onto the chair, the dancer put her hands on my knees and forced them apart, which got a bunch of people all riled up again. I shook my head and said, \"no, no, no...\" but I was also laughing which might have sent a mixed message. When the guy joined in I felt things really crossed the line. He put his leg up, foot on the arm of the chair, and was thrusting his groin extremely close to my face. His genitals were covered but very little was left to the imagination (and it was clear he was enjoying himself if you catch my drift). During his \"dance\" the woman was behind me, running her hands over my shoulders, down my chest and grazing my side-boob. Thankfully a sober friend pulled\/danced me away and I left the house immediately.\n\n  \nApparently the party died shortly after, they tried dancing with other people and everyone outright refused. The dancers also asked my friend's friend (the person who hired them) to tip them on my behalf (???). The woman dancer also offered a few people cocaine. I heard about this from a friend who checked in on me after she left the party that night.\n\n  \nOn Sunday I received texts from my friend's friend and a mutual friend both essentially accusing me of being rude and ruining the 'spirit' of the party. My friend's friend even asked why I came if I don't like parties. I was at a loss for words. I've been to lots of parties. I worked in the hospitality\/nightlife industry for three years. I've been to strip clubs and bachelor\/bachelorette parties with actual strippers; never in my life have I experienced anything like what I did there. Professional entertainers don't behave that way in my experience. I'm not close with my friend's friend (she's an acquaintance at best) but my other friend is a reasonable person, she's a teacher and fairly 'normal' all around. I've always thought highly of her and respected her opinions. Now I'm wondering if what I did was actually asshole behavior?",
