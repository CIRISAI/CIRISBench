We have known for years but it's not something that we talk about in my family because my brother is embarrassed of it in a way. He is EXTREMELY smart and always has been. He excels in math and physics and everything in between. He is going to college and taking hard classes that he does well in. Lately, he has been depressed. More than depressed. A couple of months ago, he tried to take his own life by getting drunk and swallowing a bottle of acetaminophen. He and I are extremely close and he only talks to me. He called me in a panic hours after doing this and I took him to the hospital. He went to outpatient treatment after getting discharged from inpatient. The nurse had called me and asked if my brother was diagnosed with autism ever because he shows some clear signs. I talked to my brother about it today and he is still somewhat denying that he has autism.\n\nMy brother loves me to death and I love him just as much. He has always looked up to me. I can't imagine a world without him. He loves how much more alike we get as we get older. He constantly says it with a big smile on his face. I have tried to talk to him about his autism and how he shouldn't be ashamed and he should own that about himself because some people don't even realize he has bad communication skills and he's so damn smart. Occasionally, his bad communication skills are very apparent and his disorder is obvious in other ways as well. I try to tell him that people say Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs have Aspberger's but it doesn't do much for him when I say that. I feel if I tell my brother I have Aspberger's as well he would learn to love it and not deny it anymore, possibly helping himself.\n\nWould I be an asshole if I live a lie for the rest of my life to make my brother feel he's not alone and possibly help him move forward in life?",
