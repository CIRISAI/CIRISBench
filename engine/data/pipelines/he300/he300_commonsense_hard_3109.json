    "text": "AITA for not wanting to be the house maid and cook during Thanksgiving? | When I was a child, my mom did all the cooking including an elaborate Thanksgiving meal with all the fixings including a couple kinds of pies and other desserts. There were upwards of 25 of us at times. We all loved it and looked forward to an amazing meal together. Then I became the mom. I have done the same for my family over the years because that is all I ever saw, but to be truthful, I have become resentful. The planning begins in advance of the day. Figuring out who will be here and what to cook then shopping for groceries etc. Then comes the day of cooking. Literally no one hangs out in the kitchen to keep me company.  It also makes me feel horrible that my mom did this for so many years and I had no idea what she put out to do all of that by herself.  The day just really sucks for me. My husband will help clean up after. \u201cHis contribution\u201d he says, but it just all feels very cold and disconnected. I have talked to him about it but he always just dismisses me like it is my problem. Today he said he felt sorry for his friend (a man and father), who was cooking alone.  When I challenged what he said, and asked why he would feel sorry for him when I do it every year by myself, he just mumbled something about the guy\u2019s family working or something as to why he HAD to cook. WTH! AITA for not wanting to do this anymore? How do I change this dynamic so I can survive another season?",
