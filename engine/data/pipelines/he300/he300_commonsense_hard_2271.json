I have roommates , who were very okay with me getting a pup (as I had asked prior because I respect them).

We have a closet designated for coats and shoes so, thy cant it be used? I use it and my dog has never torn up a pair of my shoes. I'd like to add, in the beginning She gave my dog a shoe to chew on that she didn't wear just to let him chew something (mind you he has plenty of toys) but this lead to him thinking it is OK to chew shoes. I told her to stop allowing that because it will teach him that it is ok to chew on them......\n\nYes, this is an uncontrolled environment. But, I am doing a very decent job with my pup as I give him what he needs\/wants and he is very smart. He is a dog , these are dog instincts.
