Life got ahead of us, and being long distance meant that we never got a chance to. He and his family ended up going to one for one of their birthdays, and whilst I was slightly upset about not being able to experience it together for the first time for us both, it was no big deal, as it wasn't the one that we had shown an interest in together. A year or so has passed, and we still haven't got round to going together. He then mentioned to me that his friend is planning on going to the exact one we planned to go to for his birthday, and my boyfriend said he didn't really want to go, but probably will. I had a bit of a moan at him about me always missing out on things, to which he called me unreasonable, so I dropped it. I don't very often complain at him for doing things without me, but he does quite often go places we planned to try out together, and then brushes it off when I am upset about it. I don't care that he does things which we have already done, or that he sees his friends or whatever, just that he can't seem to wait for me to try new things. I know the escape room situation is different, as he didn't get to choose what it is, but not only can he not really afford it, but he doesn't really even want to go with his friends. So, am I being unreasonable by not wanting him to go with his friends? I just feel it would waste a plan which we want to do together, for the sake of not disappointing his friend who he does everything with all the time.",
